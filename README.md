# Blackjack Project
This is  simple application that can play 1 hand of blackjack.
# Description
The user kicks off the application and the the dealer deals the player two cards face up, while the dealer receives 1 card face down and and one card face up. If the player receives a Blackjack, the game will end with the user winning. If the user does not have a Blackjack, the user can choose to hit (receive another card) or stand (end the hand with the current total). The player can do this until they either stand or bust. If the player busts, the game is over. If the player does not bust, the dealer will then show both cards to the player. If the dealer hand is less than 17, the dealer will hit until the hand is either above 17 however below 21. If the dealer hand is above 21, the dealer busts and the player wins.

# Issues Encountered
Issues encountered adding cards to the dealer hand. Got confused on the organization and extension of the dealer class. Encapsulating the dealer class was also a challenge. That class plays a large roll in the program.
